## Professional Summary

Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building scalable, maintainable, and performance-driven web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks and backend technologies.

From exploring programming as a hobby to developing full-stack applications, I have been driven by solving real-world problems through clean architecture, optimized performance, and user-centric design. I focus on building reliable systems that support long-term business growth while maintaining code quality and scalability.

I follow modern development practices such as component-based architecture, RESTful APIs, responsive and cross-browser design, and performance optimization to deliver production-ready solutions.
